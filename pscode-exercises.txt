// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

write out the problem x / 2 
replace x with any integer
complete the problem by dividing the integer by 2
return the result of the problem
if a whole number is returned then write "The number is even"
if a whole number is not returned then write "the number is odd"

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

add 5 numbers of your choosing together to get the sum of those 5 numbers
take the sum of those 5 numbers and divide them by 5 to get the average
look at the provided 5 numbers and find the smallest number
look at the provided 5 numbers and find the largest number
write a message with the result from step b saying "x is the average of the 5 numbers provided"
write a message with the result from step c saying "x is the smallest number that was provided and y is the largest number that was provided"
